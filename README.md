h4. Python genetic algorithm for travelling salesman problem

The most interesting in this repo is the genetic algorithm for solving the TSP problem:
* Uses order crossover operator for mating
* Has six predefined data sets and a way to randomly generate a new one 
* Allows easy adjustment of population size and number of generations
* Gives an overview of what happened during the run and the progress towards the best result

Apart from the TSP, there are also other simple problems solved via genetic algorithm 
I did to learn it and get more familiar with coding in python.
